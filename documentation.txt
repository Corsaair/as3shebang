as3shebang

Run ActionScript 3.0 shell scripts

This is an executable program based on the RedTamarin runtime,
designed to help you run ActionScript 3.0 shell scripts.

It allows you to run uncompiled ActionScript 3.0 source code or scripts
as an executable program.

As any shell scripts make the script executable
and use the following as first line:

"#!/usr/bin/as3shebang -- "

Written for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows, 32-bit and 64-bit,
it supports the full ActionScriopt 3.0 language features and the RedTamarin API.

Other features are a C POSIX API, File System, Sockets, etc.
and many more, please consult the online documentation related
to the RedTamarin runtime version 0.4.1T174.

This package is currently beta, mostly tested under:
Ubuntu 14, Debian 7, Mac OS X 10.9, Mac OS X 10.10, and Windows 7.

Because the scripts are evaluated at runtime you may encounter some glitches
with imported classes or packages not reckonised by the environment.
One simple workaround is to type your variables with the ANY type (*).

Also, AS3 shell scripts containing the shebang line are incompatible
to run with the redshell (./redshell script.as) or to be compiled with ASC.

as3shebang is compiled with the redshell debug debugger,
if your shell script contain errors you will obtain a stacktrace

--------
#!/usr/bin/as3shebang -- 

trace( "UNKNOWN = " + UNKNOWN );
--------

--------
ReferenceError: Error #1065: Variable UNKNOWN is not defined.
	at global$init()[:2]
	at shell::Runtime$/eval()
	at global$init()
--------



Other subtle differences are:

Program.argv or C.argv and C.argc
will not take into account the as3shebang executable

./test a b c
--------
argv[0] = a
argv[1] = b
argv[2] = c
--------

Program.filename will resolve to the as3shebang executable
--------
Program.filename = /usr/bin/as3shebang
--------

Program.startupDirectory will correctly resolve to the path from where
the shell script has been invoked

from within the shell script you will have access
to 2 magic global variables

as3shebang - a String containing the version of the as3sheabng executable
--------
as3shebang = 0.9
--------

scriptname - a String containing the call path to the shell script
--------
scriptname = ./test.as
--------

example shell script:

test.as
--------
#!/usr/bin/as3shebang -- 

import shell.Program;
import shell.FileSystem;

trace( "hello world" );

for( var i:uint = 0; i < Program.argv.length; i++ )
{
	trace( "argv[" + i + "] = " + Program.argv[i] );
}

trace( "as3shebang = " + as3shebang );
trace( "scriptname = " + scriptname );
trace( "Program.filename = " + Program.filename );
trace( "startupDirectory = " + Program.startupDirectory );
--------
