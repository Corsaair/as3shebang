Description: Run ActionScript 3.0 shell scripts
 This is an executable program based on the RedTamarin runtime,
 designed to help you run AS3 shell scripts. It allows you to run
 uncompiled ActionScript 3.0 source code as an executable shell script.
 Written for Linux 32-bit and 64-bit, it supports the full
 ActionScriopt 3.0 language features and the RedTamarin API.
 .
 Other features are a C POSIX API, File System, Sockets, etc.
 and many more, please consult the online documentation related
 to the RedTamarin runtime version 0.4.1T174.
 .
 This package is currently beta, mostly tested under Ubuntu and Debian.
 Because it is evaluating the scripts at runtime you may encounter some glitches
 with imported classes or packages not reckonised by the environment.
